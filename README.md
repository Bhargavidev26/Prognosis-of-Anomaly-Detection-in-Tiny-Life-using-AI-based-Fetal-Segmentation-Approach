# Prognosis-of-Anomaly-Detection-in-Tiny-Life-using-AI-based-Fetal-Segmentation-Approach
This project uses deep learning models like U-Net and SegNet for detecting fetal anomalies and brain tumors. It automates fetal head circumference measurement and brain tumor segmentation using ultrasound and MRI images, improving diagnostic accuracy in prenatal and neurological healthcare.
